Welcome to the game Best of 5. This game is very similar to Tic Tac Toe, but it is more challenging and strategic. 
This game is a battle of wits where two players take turns placing their marks, X or O, on a 20 x 20 board. 
The objective is simple: be the first to align five of your marks in a row, whether it be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
